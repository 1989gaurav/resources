### Penetration Testing
* Actively trying to find exploitable vulnerabilities
* It can be done at various level of granularity
 * Single Program
 * Complete application (communicating process)
 * Network of many application

* Automated tools to probe the systems and make sure weakness affect the system
* Seperate team from developers with specialized skill set
* Given various level of access like from no access(attacker) to full access(administrators)

#### Penetrations 
* exploitable and reproducible
* No false alarm
* Fixes imply clear improvement of security
* Absense does not imply absense of vulnerability
* Any system changes need to be retested
