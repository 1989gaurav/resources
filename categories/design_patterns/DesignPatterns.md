Design patterns are meant to help you recognize and solve the common problems that arise repeatedly when you are building software. The advantage of design patterns is that they let you rapidly wing your way past the problems that some- one has already solved, so that you can get on to the hard stuff, the code that is unique to your situation. 

The first few times we see a problem we may improvise and invent a solution on the spot, but if that same problem keeps reappearing, we will come up with a standard operating procedure to cover it. Donâ€™t, as the old saying goes, keep reinventing the wheel.

### Meta Patterns:
#### Separate Out the Things That Change from Those That Stay the Same
A key goal of software engineering is to build systems that allow us to contain the damage. In an ideal system, all changes are local. If you can identify which aspects of your system design are likely to change, you can isolate those bits from the more stable parts.
#### Program to an interface, not an implementation.
#### Prefer composition over inheritance
#### Delegate, delegate, delegate
