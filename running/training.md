### Types
* Easy
* Marathon
* Threshold
* Interval
* Repetitive


#### Easy(E)
* HR 59-74% 115-143, Z-2
* VO2 Max 65-78%
* Purpose: 
 * Build a certain degree of resistance to injury
 * Helps in developing health muscles
 * Increase in vascularization
 * Improves delivery of blood
* Suggestions:
 * Minimum 30 minutes
 * Maximum 150 minutes(2.5 hour) unless preparing for an ultra run
 * Do not take any energy drink so your body learns to conserve carbohydrate
 * Drink water in between(but not too much)

##### Long run and increas in mileage(L)
* Pace same as easy
* 30% of weekly mileage, 15-20KM
* Less tha 150 minutes(2.5 hour)
* Confidence boost 

#### Marathon Pace(M)
* Average pace should be your projected pace
* Pace should vary between Easy and Threshold, 6.5min/km
* Lesser than 110 minutes or 18 miles(29km), whichever is lower
* More than 20% of weekly mileage, so around 10-12km
* Purpose
 * Adjust to the pace
 * Adjust to drinking while at that pace
 * Buiild mental strength to gain confidence 

#### Threshold running(T)
* HR: 88 to 90%, 170-175, Z4-Z5
* 86-88% VO2 max
* Working comfortably hard, not hard
* Tempo run(same pace for 20-30 minute) or Cruise run(rest in between)
* not more than 10%
* Pace should be managable for atleast 20-30 minutes, 6-6.5min/km
* Easier to run in group or with partner
* Suggested to mix it with marathon run, like 8M + 1T + 4M + 1T + 1M
* Purpose:
 * Allow your body to improve its ability to clear blood lactate and keep it below a fairly managable level
 * Teach your body about how to deal with slightly more demanding pace for a prolonged time
 * Imrove mental ability
 * Improve speed

#### Interval/Hard training( I/H )
* VO2/HR: Maximum HR and VO2
* Interval: Optimal time 3-5 minutes
* Rest: It should be run in repetition like 5 times with recovery jogs in between of two runs
* Pace: Something which you can maintain for 10-12 minutes in race
* 8% of weekly time for I/H training, should not be more than 10K
* Purpose:
 * 
* Suggestion:
 * Recovery jog should not be more than H/I time run, suggested time is half time of faster run


#### Repetitive Running
* Same rest as fast runs, like 400m fast run and 400m recovery jog
* Less than 5% of weekly workout
* Faster bout should not be longer than 2 minutes
* Purpose:
 * Improve speed and maintain a good mechanics
* Suggested:
 * 8x200 with 200m Jog
 * 2 sets of (2x200 with 200jog, 200 with 400jog, 400 with 200jog)


#### Treadmill training
* Helpful during adverse weather
* Helps in recovering injuries during rehabilitation
* Helps in controlling intensity of the workout
* Helps in simulating hill training
* Running on treadmill requires slight less energy than ground due to head wind
* Lack of air resistence on treadmill makes cool down harder due to the warm/humid air layer around the body
